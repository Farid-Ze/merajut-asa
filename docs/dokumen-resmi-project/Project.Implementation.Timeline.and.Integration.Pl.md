# Project Implementation Timeline and Integration Plan

# Project Implementation Timeline

## Overview

The Merajut ASA platform will be implemented through a three-phase approach, allowing for strategic development, careful implementation, and community-focused growth. This document outlines the key milestones, timelines, and integration points for all team deliverables.

### Implementation Philosophy

<aside>

The project follows the "Evolution, Not Revolution" approach, focusing on enhancing existing donation experiences through superior performance, accessibility, and community engagement rather than disrupting them. This evolutionary approach is reflected in the gradual, phase-based implementation plan.
