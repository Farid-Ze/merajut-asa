### 2.1 Architecture Principles

- **Microservices-Based Architecture**: Domain-oriented services with clearly defined boundaries and responsibilities
- **API-First Development**: GraphQL API gateway providing optimized data transfer for mobile clients
- **Cloud-Native Design**: Containerized services designed for scalability, portability, and resilience
- **Progressive Web App Approach**: Offline capabilities and mobile-optimized experience without requiring app store installations
- **Security by Design Methodology**: Security considerations embedded at all architecture layers from inception
- **Accessibility by Default**: WCAG compliance and inclusive design principles built into core components

### 2.2 High-Level Component Overview

The Merajut ASA platform consists of the following primary architectural components:

1. **Client Layer**: Progressive Web App with responsive design
2. **Distribution Layer**: CDN for static asset caching and distribution
3. **Application Layer**: Server-side rendered React application
4. **API Layer**: GraphQL API gateway managing service communication
5. **Service Layer**: Microservices for domain-specific functionality
6. **Data Layer**: Polyglot persistence with relational and document databases
7. **Infrastructure Layer**: Cloud-based containerized environment

### 2.3 System Boundaries and Integrations

- **Internal Boundaries**: Clear service demarcation with defined APIs
- **External Integrations**: Payment gateways, social media APIs, analytics platforms
- **Third-Party Services**: Authentication providers, CDN, monitoring tools
