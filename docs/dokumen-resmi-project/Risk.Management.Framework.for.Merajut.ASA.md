## Risk Monitoring and Review Process

- **Regular Risk Reviews:** Bi-weekly risk assessment as part of sprint planning
- **Risk Reporting:** Monthly risk status updates to Steering Committee
- **Risk Response:** Immediate action plans for newly emerging high-impact risks
- **Risk Ownership:** Clear assignment of risk management responsibility by functional area
- **Risk Documentation:** Maintained in central repository with version control
- **Risk Adaptation:** Quarterly comprehensive risk framework review and update

### Risk Escalation Protocol

| **Risk Level** | **Escalation Path** | **Response Timeline** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Critical | Immediate notification to Project Manager and Steering Committee | Response plan within 24 hours |
| High | Notification to Project Manager and relevant Lead | Response plan within 3 days |
| Medium | Handled by functional Lead with Project Manager awareness | Response plan within 1 week |
| Low | Managed within functional team | Monitored through regular processes |

## Contingency Planning

### Critical Risk Contingencies

- **Performance Failure Contingency:** Progressive enhancement approach, offline capabilities, performance optimization sprint
- **Security Vulnerability Contingency:** Incident response protocol, predefined containment procedures, communication templates
- **Low Adoption Contingency:** Alternative engagement strategies, revised community approach, enhanced value proposition
- **Regulatory Compliance Contingency:** Legal workarounds, feature adaptation plans, regulatory negotiation approach
- **Budget Exhaustion Contingency:** Feature prioritization framework, scope reduction options, additional funding strategies

### Contingency Triggers

Specific metrics that will trigger contingency plan implementation:

- Performance > 2.0s LCP in testing
- Community adoption < 30% of target after initial launch
- Budget variance > 15% at any phase gate
- Security audit revealing critical vulnerabilities
- Partner onboarding < 50% of target by Month 12
- Team turnover > 20% within any 3-month period

## Risk Management Integration

<aside>

The risk management framework is integrated with other project management processes:

- **Sprint Planning:** Risk review incorporated into bi-weekly sprint planning
- **Change Management:** Risk assessment required for all change requests
- **Status Reporting:** Risk status included in all levels of project reporting
- **Performance Evaluation:** Risk management effectiveness included in team performance metrics
- **Governance Reviews:** Risk framework effectiveness evaluated by Steering Committee quarterly
</aside>

## Critical Success Factors for Risk Management

- **Culture of Transparency:** Creating environment where risks are openly discussed without blame
- **Proactive Identification:** Encouraging forward-looking risk identification at all levels
- **Clear Accountability:** Ensuring every risk has an owner responsible for mitigation
- **Data-Driven Assessment:** Using metrics and evidence to evaluate risk probability and impact
- **Adaptive Approach:** Continuously refining risk strategies based on project evolution
- **Integration with Governance:** Embedding risk management in overall project governance

### Implementation Approach

This risk management framework will be implemented following the project's "Evolusi, Bukan Revolusi" philosophy, with gradual enhancement of risk practices throughout the project lifecycle. The framework will evolve based on project learning and changing risk landscapes, while maintaining a consistent focus on the critical success factors identified for the Merajut ASA platform.
